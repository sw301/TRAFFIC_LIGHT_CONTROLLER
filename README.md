# Traffic Light FSM Project

## Overview
This project implements a *Finite State Machine (FSM)* for controlling a traffic light system using *Intel Quartus Prime* software.  
It is designed for FPGA programming and simulation.

## File Information
- *File Name:* traffic_light.qpf  
- *File Type:* Quartus Prime Project File  
- *Purpose:* Configuration and metadata for the traffic light FSM design.

## Tools Required
- *Intel Quartus Prime* (version 2018 or later) for opening and compiling the project.  

## Key Features
- Models state transitions for a traffic light system.
- Simulates traffic light behavior including Red, Yellow, and Green states.
- Timing and transitions based on FSM logic.

## Usage
1. Open the file using Quartus Prime software.
2. Analyze the design in the *Block Diagram Editor* or *Verilog/VHDL Editor*.
3. Compile the project and simulate the FSM behavior.

## License
This project and its associated files are subject to *Intel Corporation's* licensing terms.  

---
*Note:* Further documentation may be required if the FSM logic is implemented in external Verilog or VHDL files.
